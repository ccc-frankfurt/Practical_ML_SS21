        "In this notebook we will take Shakespeares sonnets and train a recurrent neural network to generate poetry in a similar style. We will do so by training a character based simple RNN that takes in one character and learns to predict the likelihood of the next one. \n",

        "This notebook is loosely based on the following towards data science post: https://towardsdatascience.com/writing-like-shakespeare-with-machine-learning-in-pytorch-d77f851d910c . Here the author uses a PyTorch LSTM to do poetry generation and we have taken the liberty to use the author's data preprocessing steps in this notebook for convenience and have added a RNN from scratch implementation together with the PyTorch LSTM model for the later part in this notebook. \n",
        "\n",
        "After data loading, we will thus first learn how to implement a recurrent neural network in PyTorch, but with the equations written from scratch similar to our previous Numpy implementations. However, adding this custom math to the PyTorch neural network model will allow us to nevertheless leverage PyTorch's backward and automatic gradient methods so that we do not need to implement this ourselves anymore. This is very helpful if we ever plan on implementing custom functions/layers in the future. \n",
